## Branching Workflow

This repository follows a Gitflow-style workflow, with one deliberate
deviation from strict Gitflow: **feature branches are squash-merged into
`develop`**, rather than merged with a merge commit. Release and hotfix
branches still merge normally (a real merge commit), so `master`'s history
and version tags stay intact.

It defines two permanent branches and several types of short-lived
supporting branches, each with a specific purpose and merge direction.

---

### Permanent branches

| Branch    | Purpose                                                                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `master`  | Production-ready code only. Every commit on `master` is a release.                            |
| `develop` | Integration branch. Reflects the latest delivered development changes for the next release.   |

Nobody commits directly to `master` or `develop`. All changes arrive via
pull requests from supporting branches.

---

### Supporting branches

| Branch | From      | Merges into          | Merge type    | Naming             | Purpose                         |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature| `develop` | `develop`            | Squash merge  | `feature/<name>`   | New or in-progress functionality|
| Release| `develop` | `master`, `develop`  | Merge commit  | `release/<version>`| Stabilise and prepare a release |
| Hotfix | `master`  | `master`, `develop`  | Merge commit  | `hotfix/<version>` | Urgent production fixes         |

Squashing a feature branch collapses all of its commits into a single new
commit on `develop`. That commit has no merge-parent link back to
`feature/<name>`, so the branch's individual commits do not appear in
`develop`'s history — only the squashed result does.

   checkout develop
   merge release/v1.0.0
   checkout master
   branch hotfix/v1.0.1
   checkout hotfix/v1.0.1
   commit id: "fix"
   checkout master
   merge hotfix/v1.0.1 tag: "v1.0.1"
   checkout develop
   merge hotfix/v1.0.1
```

---

### Naming conventions

- Feature branches: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g. `feature/login-page`)
- Release branches: `release/<version>` (e.g. `release/v1.1.0`)
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<version>` (e.g. `hotfix/v1.0.1`)

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

---

### Workflow

#### Starting a feature

```text
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
```

Push the branch and open a pull request into `develop` when ready.
**Squash merge** the pull request — GitHub's "Squash and merge" option, or
the CLI equivalent — so the feature lands on `develop` as one commit.
Delete the feature branch once merged.

#### Starting a release

When `develop` has enough features for a release:

```text
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/<version>
```

Only bug fixes, documentation, and release-related chores (version bumps,
changelog) belong on a release branch — no new features.

When the release branch is stable:

1. Open a pull request from `release/<version>` into `master`. Merging tags
   the resulting commit as `<version>`.
2. `sync-master-to-develop.yaml` automatically opens **and merges** a pull
   request bringing that merge into `develop` (a regular merge commit,
   not squash) — no manual step needed, so the fixes made during
   stabilisation aren't lost.
3. Delete the release branch.

#### Starting a hotfix

For an urgent fix to production:

```text
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b hotfix/<version>
```

When the fix is ready:

1. Open a pull request from `hotfix/<version>` into `master`. Merging tags
   the resulting commit as `<version>`.
2. `sync-master-to-develop.yaml` automatically opens **and merges** a pull
   request bringing that merge into `develop` (a regular merge commit,
   not squash) — no manual step needed, so the fix is included in future
   releases. ⚠️ **Caution:** this automation only syncs into `develop`. If a
   `release/*` branch is active at the same time, merge the fix into that
   branch by hand too — the sync does not cover it.
3. Delete the hotfix branch.

---

### Pull requests

- All merges into `master` or `develop` happen via pull request — no direct
  pushes.
- A pull request into `master` must come from a `release/*` or `hotfix/*`
  branch. Enforced by the `Branch Policy Check` required status check —
  see [Continuous integration checks](#continuous-integration-checks).
- `feature/*` → `develop` pull requests must be **squash merged**.
- `release/*` and `hotfix/*` pull requests must use a regular **merge
  commit** (not squash, not rebase) — this keeps `master`'s history and
  tags accurate and preserves the full set of stabilisation commits when
  merging back into `develop`.
- Pull requests **into** `release/*` or `hotfix/*` are rejected outright
  by `check-source-branch` — these branches only ever merge *out* (to
  `master`). Push fixes to them directly instead; see
  [Starting a release](#starting-a-release) /
  [Starting a hotfix](#starting-a-hotfix).
- Force-pushing is blocked on every branch **except** `feature/*` and
  `hotfix/*`, which stay open for rebasing or amending your own
  in-progress work.
- Keep feature branches short-lived and up to date with `develop` to avoid
  large, conflict-prone merges.

---

### Closing issues

⚠️ **Caution:** merging into `develop` does **not** auto-close referenced issues, even
with GitHub's usual `Closes #123`-style keywords. GitHub only evaluates
those keywords when a pull request merges into the repository's
**default branch** (`master`) — not `develop`.

Issues are therefore **closed manually** when merging a `feature/*` pull
request, rather than automated. This is a deliberate choice, not a
limitation being worked around: closing issues by hand at merge time
means actually reviewing what a merge resolves, rather than trusting a
keyword match.

Reference the issues a pull request addresses in its description (e.g.
`References #123`) so there's a checklist to close against at merge
time, even though this reference will not trigger an automatic close.

---

## Commit message requirements

All commit messages, and `feature/*` → `develop` pull request titles and
descriptions (squashing turns the PR title + body into the actual commit
message — see [Supporting branches](#supporting-branches)), must follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) as
configured in `.config/commitlint.config.mjs`, with a custom plugin at
`.config/signed-off-by-regex.js`.

Beyond the standard Conventional Commits format, this project requires:

- A **scope** from a fixed list: `core`, `api`, `ui`, `auth`, `db`, `deps`,
  `tests`, `config`, `security`, `rebase`.
- A **subject in the imperative mood** — "add", "update", "fix", not
  "added", "updated", "fixed". Read it as completing "This commit will
  ...".
- A **body** of at least 10 characters, in sentence case.
- A **`Signed-off-by: Name <email@example.com>`** line — a
  [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)-style
  sign-off, not a cryptographically signed commit.

⚠️ **Not yet enforced by commitlint:** the imperative-mood rule above is
currently a convention only — `.config/commitlint.config.mjs` has no rule
checking it (commitlint has no built-in imperative-mood check), so
"added"/"updated" subjects will still pass CI today. See the TODO in that
file for tightening this.

🔒 **Separately enforced by branch protection, not commitlint:** every
commit, on every branch, must be **cryptographically signed** (GPG or
SSH) — this is a repository rule, checked at push time, not a commitlint
rule. It's a different requirement from the `Signed-off-by` line above:
that's a DCO-style text trailer commitlint checks the content of; this is
a real cryptographic signature Git itself verifies. Configure commit
signing locally (see
[GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification))
or pushes will be rejected outright, regardless of message content.

Example:

```text
feat(core): add player movement

Adds basic WASD movement to the player controller.

Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
```

## Continuous integration checks

Pushing to a `feature/*` branch, and opening a pull request into `develop`
or `master`, each trigger automated checks:

| Check                    | Runs on                                  | What it checks                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `preview / commitlint`   | Push to `feature/*`                      | Latest commit message; see [requirements][cm] |
| `preview / markdownlint` | Push to `feature/*`                      | Every Markdown file in the repository         |
| `lint-pr-message`        | `feature/*` → `develop` pull requests    | PR title and body become the squash commit    |
| `check-source-branch`    | Pull requests into `master` or `develop` | PR source branch matches the allowed pairings |

[cm]: #commit-message-requirements

`preview / commitlint` and `preview / markdownlint` also register a
`preview` GitHub Deployment for the commit.

🚨 **Warning:** do **not** add a "Require deployments to succeed: preview"
branch protection rule on `develop` — this was tried and it breaks
GitHub's auto-merge feature outright ("Failed enabling auto-merge for
pull request"), even when every check is genuinely passing. It's also
redundant: the jobs that create the `preview` deployment are the same
jobs already enforced as required status checks above, so the rule adds
no protection that isn't already there. Require the status checks
themselves, not the deployment.

`preview / commitlint` and `preview / markdownlint` also register a
`preview` GitHub Deployment for the commit, so a "Require deployments to
succeed: preview" branch protection rule has something to check against.

## Code comment style

In source-code comments (`.mjs`, `.js`, `.sh`, `.yaml`, etc.), prefer
backticks (`` ` ``) over single quotes (`'`) when quoting an identifier,
value, file path, or branch name — e.g. `` `feature/*` `` rather than
`'feature/*'`. This matches how this document quotes identifiers and
keeps quoting consistent between prose and code.
