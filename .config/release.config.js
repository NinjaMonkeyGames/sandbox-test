// semantic-release config, loaded by release.yaml via:
//   npx semantic-release --extends ./.config/release.config.js
// (semantic-release only auto-discovers config at the repo root, hence
// --extends rather than a root-level .releaserc).
//
// package.json has "type": "module", so this file is loaded as an ES
// module (a plain top-level `export default`, no .mjs extension needed).
//
// Branch -> channel mapping, matching detect-environment.yaml /
// release.yaml exactly:
//   master     -> stable release, "latest" dist-tag / no prerelease suffix
//   develop    -> beta prerelease (e.g. 1.4.0-beta.1)
//   release/*  -> rc prerelease   (e.g. 1.4.0-rc.1)
// hotfix/* is deliberately NOT listed here, same as release.yaml's own
// trigger: hotfix branches don't get a semantic-release run at all. If
// that changes, add it in both files at once - see release.yaml's
// comment on this.
//
// Commit parsing / release notes both use the Conventional Commits
// preset (conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits), the same preset
// commitlint is configured against elsewhere in this repo - one commit
// grammar, not two.
// CONFIRMED LIVE: `release/*` here matches EVERY branch in the repo that
// fits the glob, not just "the" release branch - and semantic-release
// resolves it that way on every single run, for every branch, not only
// when a release/* branch itself is what triggered the run. Two
// release/* branches coexisting (e.g. an old one left over after merging
// to master instead of being deleted) both get the same fixed
// prerelease: 'rc' identifier, which semantic-release refuses outright
// (EPRERELEASEBRANCHES - it needs a unique identifier per branch to know
// which branch a version like 1.0.0-rc.1 belongs to) - and because
// branch validation runs unconditionally, that one stray branch breaks
// EVERY future release.yaml run repo-wide, not just release/* ones,
// until it's deleted.
//
// This config has always assumed exactly one release/* branch exists at
// a time - nothing in detect-environment.yaml/deploy.yaml/
// branch-protection.yaml distinguishes multiple concurrent ones either.
// Enable "Automatically delete head branches" in repo Settings > General
// so a merged release/*|hotfix/* branch can't linger and silently
// reintroduce this.
