#
# One-time template setup: renames every occurrence of the placeholder
# project name "grid-utility-professional" - in file CONTENTS, file NAMES,
# and directory NAMES - to whatever this new project should actually be
# called, then deletes itself. Run this exactly once, right after cloning
# this template to start a new game:
#
#   ./setup-project.sh
#
# Both content and paths need renaming, not just content: this repo's own
# CI (preview.yaml's gm-cli-tests/gm-cli-compile jobs, for one) sets
# `working-directory: ./grid-utility-professional` - updating file
# contents alone would leave those paths pointing at a directory that no
# longer exists under its old name, and renaming paths alone would leave
# every reference to the old path dangling instead.
#
# Two things are excluded from every pass, and both are structural
# necessities rather than convenience exceptions:
#   - .git/ - it's git's own internal object database, not "your files".
#     A text/rename pass through it would corrupt the repository itself,
#     unrelated to what this script is actually for.
#   - This script's own file - it necessarily contains the placeholder
#     string in its own comments and instructions (as you're reading right
#     now), and it deletes itself once it's done regardless, so rewriting
#     its own content first would be pointless at best.
#
# Binary files are skipped during the CONTENT replacement pass specifically
# (detected via the same "does this file have a NUL byte" idea git/grep use
# internally, through `grep -Iq`) - not a quiet loophole in "no exceptions",
# but because a text substitution on binary bytes (a sprite PNG, an audio
# file) doesn't rename anything inside it, it corrupts it. Any binary file
# whose NAME contains the placeholder is still renamed - this only ever
# affects file content.
#
# Only a restricted charset - letters, digits, hyphens and underscores, the
# same shape as the placeholder name itself - is accepted for the new name.
# That isn't an arbitrary restriction: it sidesteps every sed/regex special
# character a freeform name could otherwise contain, so the substitution
# below can stay a plain literal replace instead of a hand-rolled escaping
# scheme, and a project name built from anything outside that charset would
# cause its own problems elsewhere anyway (GameMaker project files, CI
# working-directory paths, shell-quoting in this repo's own other scripts).
#
# Also patches package.json's own project-identity fields - "name",
# "description", "homepage", "bugs".url, and "repository".url - which is
# what previously had to be done by hand, in a separate manual step, right
# after running this script. All five fields currently hold the exact same
# placeholder string (package.json's own "name" field), so replacing every
# occurrence of THAT string - read from the file itself, not assumed to be
# any particular value - updates every one of them in a single pass, the
# same literal-replace mechanism as the rest of this script. This assumes
# the project stays under the same GitHub org/user the template itself was
# generated under; if it doesn't, "repository.url" (and, if it matters,
# "homepage"/"bugs".url) still need a manual fix afterward, same as before
# this script covered the rest.
#
# Last step: seeds .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG with an example commit message in
# this repo's own conventional-commit format, so the first `git commit` run
# after setup (committing the rename itself) already opens with a filled-in
# starting point instead of a blank editor - `git commit` uses that file as
# its default message body whenever one isn't given some other way (-m,
# --amend, etc.), same as when a commit is interrupted and resumed.

# Escapes a literal string for safe use as the search pattern in a sed
